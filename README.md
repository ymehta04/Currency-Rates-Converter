Concepts Used-
Principle of webscrapping is used in order to fetch the details of currency rates from x-rates. BeautifulSoup is used to read data from the site and fetch it into a string format. The data is then stored int a .csv file. If a reading is to be continued then the same filename is to be entered. Else a new filename is given. Then the data is fetched from the csv file and plotted onto a graph. Numpy and matplotlib is used for the same.

Package installation required-
numpy,matplotlib,beautifulsoup

Steps-

1)First download the currency.python file and dol1.csv and save it into your pycharm(recommended) project.

2)Run it.

3)When filename is asked one can either write dol1.csv to continue with the same file or a provide a new name altogether for a new file to be made.

Note: Existing csv file is not a compulsion for the code to run. Just try the other alternative as mentioned in step 3 and you are good to go.
